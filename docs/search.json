    "text": "Who Wants to Be a Deputy? A Multilevel Analysis of the 2022 Elections for the Chamber of Deputies\nWhat increases a candidate’s chances of being elected? The specialized Political Science literature has sought to answer this question through various approaches over time. This work provides a statistical analysis of the 2022 electoral data to evaluate what impacts the chances of federal deputy candidates being elected in Brazil. Statistical modeling techniques are applied, including multilevel logistic regression models and metrics for evaluating the explanatory and predictive capacity of models. The results suggest that campaign expenditures, with variations between parties, account for a significant portion of the results at the polls.\nKeywords: Legislative Elections; Logistic Regression; Multilevel Models; Model Evaluation.\nThe work has been completed and received the highest grade."
