## üíº Current Roles

#### üìç **Consultant in Data Science & Research** (07/2024 ‚Äì Present)

My expertise spans the entire data pipeline‚Äîdesigning ETL systems, conducting causal inference, and implementing machine learning models (including Generative AI solutions). Current services include:

- End-to-end data science and AI development, including RAG pipelines and chatbot solutions
- Research support (survey design, causal analysis, data visualization)
- Tailored training and workshops in data science and programming fundamentals

I have partnered with NGOs, public agencies, think tanks, and private firms to offer data-driven solutions. If you think I can help you in any way, please reach out at [felipe.lamarca@hotmail.com](mailto:felipe.lamarca@hotmail.com).

Feel free to explore my open-source projects [here](../projects/projects.qmd) or on my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/felipelmc).

#### üìç **Data Scientist & Researcher** @ [Instituto Rio21](https://rio21.org/) (04/2022 ‚Äì Present)

I conduct quantitative research (such as opinion polls and social surveys), focusing on data collection, analysis, and visualization. I have participated in projects like the [Municipal Management Assessment Survey](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nUVQnHgi2kvHHau5rcxC-5DzTkeuOk75/view?usp=sharing) and [Election Polls](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Q1y1tIzLF4i6bh9W0K6SvRm_XvSt4ISr/view?usp=sharing), while collaborating with [Alian√ßa CentroRio](https://alianca-cidade.org/) to transform citywide conservation and security data into actionable intelligence.  

On a day-to-day basis, I use Python and R to build statistical analyses, interactive maps, and dashboards. I also automate post-stratification processes for survey data and develop geoprocessing solutions for mapping projects.

#### üìç **Data Science Consultant** @ [Study Group on New Illegalisms](https://geni.uff.br/) (GENI/UFF) (01/2025 ‚Äì Present)

I build custom tools for data extraction and analysis, particularly those leveraging large language models. This includes creating Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines and solutions to automatically format unstructured data.

#### üìç **Research Assistant** @ [FGV EBAPE](https://ebape.fgv.br/en) (02/2025 ‚Äì Present)

I am part of a project to systematize databases for election results from the 1970s, using OCR and large language models to digitize and format historical documents. I work under the supervision of Prof. Cesar Zucco, Ph.D.
