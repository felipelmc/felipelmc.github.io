## üíº Current Roles

### Consultant in Data Science & Research

I'm a data science consultant specializing in end-to-end solutions for data challenges. My expertise spans the entire data pipeline, from designing ETL systems to implementing machine learning models, including GenAI applications.
My services include:

- Custom data science solutions and ML model development
- Research support, including data collection, analysis, and visualization
- Tailored training and workshops in data science and programming fundamentals

Current and past clients include NGOs, companies, public officials, politicians, and researchers from Brazilian think tanks and universities. If you think I can help you in any way, please reach out to me at [felipe.lamarca@hotmail.com](mailto:felipe.lamarca@hotmail.com).

You can also explore my open-source projects [here](../projects/projects.qmd) or on [GitHub profile](https://github.com/felipelmc).

### Data Scientist & Researcher @ [Instituto Rio21](https://rio21.org/)

I have been working at Instituto Rio21 since 2022, focusing on data collection, analysis, and visualization, with a special emphasis on opinion polls and social surveys. I have been involved in projects such as the [Municipal Management Assessment Survey](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nUVQnHgi2kvHHau5rcxC-5DzTkeuOk75/view?usp=sharing) and [Election Polls](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Q1y1tIzLF4i6bh9W0K6SvRm_XvSt4ISr/view?usp=sharing), while also working closely with [Alian√ßa CentroRio](https://alianca-cidade.org/) to improve city life by turning data on conservation and security into intelligence.

In a daily basis, I use tools such as Python and R to build interactive maps, dashboards, and statistical analysis.

## üìÅ Past Work

### Data Science Intern @ FGV SPE

I worked mainly on the incorporation of advanced GenAI techniques into the area's data pipeline and identifying opportunities for automation and process improvement. I also supported the development of presentations for C-level executives, including the FGV's President.

### Data Scientist @ [Visagio](https://visagio.com/en/home/)

As a part-time data scientist at Visagio, I worked on a variety of projects, including optimization, pricing, A/B testing, and Power BI dashboard development. I led the automation of the data pipeline using SQL and presented KPI-driven insights to senior management.

### Student Consultant @ [Brazilian Sailing Confederation](https://www.cbvela.org.br/)
With the help of some friends, I developed a ranking model for Brazilian sailors, integrating web scraping and machine learning to analyze regatta performance. 

### Junior Research Fellow @ [FGV CPDOC](https://cpdoc.fgv.br/en)
Under the supervision of Prof. [Jaqueline Porto Zulini](https://cpdoc.fgv.br/equipe/jaquelinezulini), Ph.D., I analyzed Executive-Legislative relations (1900-1930) qualitatively, and a little bit quantitatively, using R. This was my very first experience with quantitative text analysis, even though it was not the main focus of the project.

### Researcher @ [FGV](https://portal.fgv.br/en)
Under the supervision of Prof. [Jimmy Medeiros](https://cpdoc.fgv.br/equipe/JimmyMedeiros), Ph.D., I translated and adapted tutorials for the [Programming Historian in Portuguese](https://programminghistorian.org/pt/).
