## Current work

I am a **Data Scientist and Researcher** at [Instituto Rio21](https://rio21.org/). Here, I work on projects related data collection, analysis, and visualization. I also conduct opinion polls and surveys such as the [Municipal Management Assessment Survey](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nUVQnHgi2kvHHau5rcxC-5DzTkeuOk75/view?usp=sharing) and [Election Polls](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Q1y1tIzLF4i6bh9W0K6SvRm_XvSt4ISr/view?usp=sharing) using post-stratification techniques. We provide services to the project [Alian√ßa CentroRio](https://alianca-cidade.org/), which aims to improve the quality of life in the downtown area of Rio de Janeiro by monitoring the city hall performance in services related to conservation and security. My work involves geo-referencing data, creating interactive maps and dashboards, and conducting statistical analysis.

I also work as a **freelance consultant**, offering expertise in data and social sciences to Brazilian politicians, NGOs, companies, and researchers. Companies and think tanks I have worked with include [Funda√ß√£o Roberto Marinho](https://www.frm.org.br/), [Artplan](https://artplan.com.br/), [Instituto Vini.Jr](https://institutovinijr.org.br/institute-vini-jr-en/), [FGV](https://portal.fgv.br/en), and [CEBRAP](https://cebrap.org.br/). The scope of my work ranges from data analysis and business intelligence to social science research and policy analysis. I use a variety of tools and methods, such as Python, R, SQL, Statistics, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning.

## Past work

- **Data Scientist** @ [Visagio](https://visagio.com/en/home/): In this position, I applied Data Science tools to solve a range of challenges in Pricing. My work included leading optimization and simulation analyses, designing and executing A/B tests, creating Power BI dashboards to track KPIs and prevent revenue leakage, developing automated data pipelines from a Data Warehouse using SQL, and preparing executive presentations for senior management.

- **Student Consultant** @ [CBVela](https://www.cbvela.org.br/): this field project aimed to develop ranking models for Brazilian sailors based on their performance in regattas. I worked with a team of students from FGV EMAp and applied web scraping, data cleaning, and machine learning techniques to build a ranking model that could effectively reflect the sailors' performance.

- **Junior Research Fellow** @ [FGV CPDOC](https://cpdoc.fgv.br/en): with scholarships from FGV (2019-2021) and CNPq (2021-2022), I worked on a research project that aimed to analyze the Executive-Legislative relations during the Brazilian First Republic (1900-1930) under the supervision of Professor [Jaqueline Porto Zulini](https://cpdoc.fgv.br/equipe/jaquelinezulini), Ph.D. 

- **Researcher** @ [FGV](https://portal.fgv.br/en): I helped bringing to life the [Programming Historian in Portuguese](https://programminghistorian.org/pt/), a project that aims to teach digital methods and tools for historians and social scientists. I was responsible for translating and adapting tutorials under the supervision of Professor [Jimmy Medeiros](https://cpdoc.fgv.br/equipe/JimmyMedeiros), Ph.D.
