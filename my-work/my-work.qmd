## üìç Current Roles

### Freelance consultant in Data Science & Research

I help clients solve **data-related problems**, engaging in a wide range of projects. I have experience working on all stages of the data science pipeline, from the implementation of ETL pipelines to the development and integration of machine learning models, including GenAI applications. I also provide **research support**, such as data collection, analysis, and visualization. 

Current and past clients include NGOs, companies, public officials, politicians, and researchers from Brazilian think tanks and universities. If you think I can help you in any way, please reach out to me at [felipe.lamarca@hotmail.com](mailto:felipe.lamarca@hotmail.com).

You can also explore my **open-source projects** [here](../projects/projects.qmd) or on [GitHub profile](https://github.com/felipelmc).

### Data Scientist & Researcher @ [Instituto Rio21](https://rio21.org/)

I have been working at Instituto Rio21 since 2022, focusing on data collection, analysis, and visualization, with a special emphasis on opinion polls and social surveys. I have been involved in projects such as the [Municipal Management Assessment Survey](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nUVQnHgi2kvHHau5rcxC-5DzTkeuOk75/view?usp=sharing) and [Election Polls](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Q1y1tIzLF4i6bh9W0K6SvRm_XvSt4ISr/view?usp=sharing), while also working closely with [Alian√ßa CentroRio](https://alianca-cidade.org/) to improve city life by turning data on conservation and security into intelligence.

In a daily basis, I use tools such as Python, R, SQL, and PowerBI to perform geo-referencing, interactive maps, dashboards, and statistical analysis.

### Data Science Intern @ FGV SPE

The institutional goal of the Getulio Vargas Foundation is to estimulate the social and economic development of Brazil. The role of the Strategic Planning and Management Office (SPE) is to support FGV‚Äôs units in achieving institutional goals through KPI monitoring and fostering a data-driven culture. 

I have been working mainly on **incorporating advanced GenAI techniques into the area's data pipeline** and identifying opportunities for automation and process improvement. I also support the development of presentations for C-level executives.

## üëî Past Work

### Data Scientist @ [Visagio](https://visagio.com/en/home/)

As a part-time data scientist at Visagio, I worked on a variety of projects, including optimization, pricing, A/B testing, and Power BI dashboard development. I led the automation of the data pipeline using SQL and presented KPI-driven insights to senior management.

### Student Consultant @ [Brazilian Sailing Confederation](https://www.cbvela.org.br/)
With the help of some friends, I developed a ranking model for Brazilian sailors, integrating web scraping and machine learning to analyze regatta performance. 

### Junior Research Fellow @ [FGV CPDOC](https://cpdoc.fgv.br/en)
Under the supervision of Prof. [Jaqueline Porto Zulini](https://cpdoc.fgv.br/equipe/jaquelinezulini), Ph.D., I analyzed Executive-Legislative relations (1900-1930) qualitatively, and a little bit quantitatively, using R. This was my very first experience with quantitative text analysis, even though it was not the main focus of the project.

### Researcher @ [FGV](https://portal.fgv.br/en)
Under the supervision of Prof. [Jimmy Medeiros](https://cpdoc.fgv.br/equipe/JimmyMedeiros), Ph.D., I translated and adapted tutorials for the [Programming Historian in Portuguese](https://programminghistorian.org/pt/).
