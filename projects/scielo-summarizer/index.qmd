## About the project

SciELO-Summarizer consists of a summarizer for scientific articles in Portuguese. It scrapes the content of the article from the SciELO website and generates a personalized summary for the user using Large Language Models (LLMs), especifically Llama3.

To run the project locally, you need to have both Python 3.8 or higher and Llama3 installed. It is also possible to run the project on Google Colab, following this [link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1iwNWhNh3KhchKre6p6Kl8Dw55t30Zp-7?usp=sharing).

The program was developed during the [Summer Institute in Computational Social Sciences (SICSS) 2024, hosted by FGV ECMI, Brazil](https://sicss.io/2024/fgv-ecmi-brazil/), in July 2024.
