## **Assignments**

1. Nearest Neighbours Method ($k$-NN) (10/10)
2. Linear Regression (8.5/10)
3. Logistic Regression and Approximate Bayesian Inference (10/10)
4. Selection of Models and Hyperparameters (9.25/10)
5. Gaussian Processes for Regression (10/10)
6. Neural Networks (10/10)
7. Dimensionality Reduction (10/10)
8. K-means and Mixture models (8.5/10)

## **Final Project**

The [final project](https://github.com/anacarolerthal/conformal-prediction-evaluation) was co-authored by [Ana Carolina Erthal](https://github.com/anacarolerthal), [Guilherme de Melo](https://github.com/guilherme-melo) and Bernardo Vargas. The project implements a way of comparing Conformal Prediction with traditional machine learning approaches to generate confidence intervals.
