### Welcome!👋🏼

I am an undergraduate student pursuing dual degrees in Data Science & Artificial Intelligence at the [School of Applied Mathematics](https://emap.fgv.br/en) (FGV EMAp) and Social Sciences at the [Superior School of Social Sciences](https://cpdoc.fgv.br/en) (FGV CPDOC). My academic background combines a strong foundation in mathematics, programming, and social sciences, with a focus on political science and computational social sciences. I apply this knowledge to tackle complex challenges in both the public and private sectors, while also contributing to the scientific community.

I'm mainly interested in the following topics:

- Statistics, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning
- Computational Social Sciences, Political Science, and Public Policy
- AI Safety and Governance
- Open source tools and reproducible research
