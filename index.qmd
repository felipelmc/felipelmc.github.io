### Welcome!👋🏼

I am an undergraduate student pursuing dual degrees in Data Science & Artificial Intelligence at the [School of Applied Mathematics](https://emap.fgv.br/en) (FGV EMAp) and Social Sciences at the [Superior School of Social Sciences](https://cpdoc.fgv.br/en) (FGV CPDOC). My academic background combines a strong foundation in mathematics, programming, and social sciences, with a focus on political science and computational social science. I apply this knowledge to tackle complex challenges in both the public and private sectors, while also contributing to the scientific community.

### 👨🏻‍💻My current work

I work as a Data Scientist at [Instituto Rio21](https://rio21.org/) and serve as a freelance consultant, providing expertise in data analysis and social sciences to Brazilian politicians, NGOs, companies, and researchers. Additionally, I am a teaching assistant for the "Quantitative Methods II" course at FGV CPDOC.

I'm mainly interested in the following topics:

- Statistics, Machine Learning & Deep Learning
- Computational Social Sciences & Political Science
- AI Safety & Governance
- Open Science [🔗](https://github.com/felipelmc)

### Fun Facts

- Born and raised in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil 🇧🇷
- Enjoy playing video games🎮 and (occasionally) exercising🏃🏻
