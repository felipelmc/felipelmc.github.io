### Welcome!👋🏼

I'm a data scientist from the [School of Applied Mathematics](https://emap.fgv.br/en) (FGV EMAp) and a social scientist from the [School of Social Sciences](https://cpdoc.fgv.br/en) (FGV CPDOC). Currently, I am pursuing a Master's degree in Political Science at the [Institute of Social and Political Studies](https://iesp.uerj.br/en/) (IESP-UERJ). My academic background combines training in mathematics, programming, and social sciences, with a focus on political science and computational social sciences. 

I've been working as a data scientist and researcher for a few years now, gaining experience through a variety of projects along the way.

I'm mainly interested in the following topics:

- Statistics, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning
- Computational Social Sciences, Political Science, and Public Policy
- Open source tools and reproducible research
- AI Safety and Governance
