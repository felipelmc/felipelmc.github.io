### Welcome!👋🏼

I'm a data scientist with a degree from the [School of Applied Mathematics](https://emap.fgv.br/en) (FGV EMAp) and a social scientist with a degree from the [School of Social Sciences](https://cpdoc.fgv.br/en) (FGV CPDOC). Currently, I'm pursuing a Master's degree in Political Science at the [Institute of Social and Political Studies](https://iesp.uerj.br/en/) (IESP-UERJ). 

I work as a data scientist at [AtlasIntel](https://atlasintel.org/) and do research at the Policy and Election Monitoring and Evaluation Laboratory ([MAPE](https://mape.org.br/)).

<!-- My academic background combines training in mathematics, programming, and social sciences, with a focus on political science and computational social sciences.  -->

My interests include Statistical Modeling, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Computational Social Sciences. I also have experience in GenAI applications, survey methods, and ETL pipelines (SQL and NoSQL).
