### Welcome!👋🏼

I'm a data scientist with a degree from the [School of Applied Mathematics](https://emap.fgv.br/en) (FGV EMAp) and a social scientist with a degree from the [School of Social Sciences](https://cpdoc.fgv.br/en) (FGV CPDOC). Currently, I'm pursuing a Master's degree in Political Science at the [Institute of Social and Political Studies](https://iesp.uerj.br/en/) (IESP-UERJ). 

<!-- My academic background combines training in mathematics, programming, and social sciences, with a focus on political science and computational social sciences.  -->

I've been working as a data scientist and researcher for a few years now, gaining experience through a variety of projects along the way.

My interests include Statistical Modeling, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Computational Social Sciences, as well as AI safety and governance. I also have experience in ETL pipelines (SQL and NoSQL), GenAI applications, and survey methods.
